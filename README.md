# Future roadmap

The following limitations will be prioritised in future updates:

**1. Lack of up-to-date data:** Implement API calls to the NBA API to fetch real-time player statistics and physical attributes from 2010‚Äì2025.

**2. Lack of informative outputs:** Display two side-by-side tables: one showcasing the most similar season of a player and the other highlighting their current stats for better comparison.

**3. Need to automate updating data:** Develop a system to automate monthly API calls, ensuring ML models are continuously updated with the latest NBA data.

**4. Extend functionality of application:** Develop a deep learning model (possible LLM using OpenAI) to predict users' NBA doppelganger.

**5. Computer vision:** Allow users to upload a photo or viddeo of themselves playing basketball, and use pose estimation models (e.g. OpenPose, MediaPipe) to analyse movement style and suggest an NBA twin using both stats and in-game movement.
